# What Are Web Components? When Should You Use Them?

In modern frontend development, we often reuse the same UI elements across different parts of an application â€” buttons, modals, dropdowns, tabs, etc. Maintaining these consistently across different projects or frameworks can become a challenge.

Thatâ€™s where **Web Components** come in.

## What Are Web Components?

Web Components are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create **custom, reusable HTML elements** â€” encapsulated and independent of the rest of your code.

They consist of 3 main technologies:

1. **Custom Elements** â€“ Define your own HTML tags (e.g. `<my-button>`).
2. **Shadow DOM** â€“ Encapsulate styles and markup so they donâ€™t leak in or out.
3. **HTML Templates** â€“ Define reusable chunks of HTML.

### Example

```html
<my-button></my-button>

<script>
  class MyButton extends HTMLElement {
    constructor() {
      super();
      const shadow = this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' });
      shadow.innerHTML = `
        <style>
          button { background: teal; color: white; padding: 8px 16px; border: none; }
        </style>
        <button><slot></slot></button>
      `;
    }
  }

  customElements.define('my-button', MyButton);
</script>
```

## When Should You Use Web Components?

Use Web Components when you need:

- **Reusable UI elements** across multiple pages or projects
- **Cross-framework compatibility** (e.g. React + Vue + plain HTML)
- **Encapsulated styling and logic** (to avoid CSS conflicts)
- A **portable UI library** to share with other teams

### Good Use Cases

- Design system components (buttons, inputs, cards)
- Custom widgets (date picker, tooltip, rating stars)
- Embeddable apps (chat widgets, dashboards, maps)

## When Not to Use Web Components

Donâ€™t use Web Components for things like:

- Utility functions (e.g. formatting dates, math)
- Algorithms or API logic (use `.js` or CDN modules instead)
- When you're building entirely within a single framework (like React or Vue) â€” their component systems are often easier to work with in that context

### TL;DR

| Use It For           | Avoid Using It For        |
|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Reusable UI elements | Pure logic or algorithms  |
| Cross-framework UI   | Framework-specific apps   |
| Encapsulated widgets | Utility JS libraries only |

## Bonus: Web Component + JS Lib = ðŸ’¡

You can also **wrap existing JS libraries** (like Chart.js or Mermaid) inside a Web Component to make them easier to use:

```html
<mermaid-diagram code="graph TD; A-->B;"></mermaid-diagram>
```

Inside, your component can handle the JS initialization logic. This gives you the best of both worlds: simple HTML API + powerful JS features.

## Final Thoughts

Web Components are a powerful tool, especially when your project needs **reusable UI that works anywhere** â€” not just in one specific framework. While theyâ€™re not a replacement for libraries like React or Vue, they are a great companion when used in the right place.

Use them wisely â€” and your future self (and teammates) will thank you.
